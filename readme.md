## Brainfuck.js

Brainfuck.js is a small brainfuck interpreter written in JS. It is not made to be reliable, and sometimes just doesn't work. The majority of brainfuck code seems to run on it quite well, though.  
This project is not actively maintained or anything like that, it was thought of as a one-time proof-of-concept.

For usage, see `index.js`. It contains a very simple usage example of the interpreter.
